# Proposal process

Changes to our product or architecture are proposed, discussed, and approved according to the following process:

1. Propose a change by opening a PR to add a new document to this directory that follows the [template](0000-00-00-template.md). The file name has the following components:
  - The date the proposal was first authored (YYYY-MM-DD).
  - The dash (`-`) separated title.
  - The markdown (`.md`) suffix.
2. Request a review from relevant owners.
3. Iterate on the proposal based on feedback until it is approved by an owner.
4. Copy the implementation checklist into a new issue and link to this issue from the proposal. Further changes to the checklist are reflected in the issue and not the proposal.
5. Merge the proposal.
