# Sourcegraph design standards

## Introduction

Sourcegraph design standards exists to:
1. Allow Sourcegraph engineers consistently use styles, modules, and elements to iterate faster without a deep-dive design consult on every commit.
2. Maintain consistency between Sourcegraph products, sites, and communications. Changing defaults should be intentional and consulted.
3. Produce a style guide that updated with Sourcegraph and across all products, sites, and communications effectively and efficiently.
4. Prevent engineers from being constrained to one design and to allow each page to be designed uniquely and consistently.


## Sourcegraph style guides

Sourcegraph has three style guides:
1. [Sourcegraph development style guide](style.md)
2. [Sourcegraph copy style guide](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/sourcegraph/about/-/blob/STYLEGUIDE.md)
3. [Sourcegraph design style guide](https://app.zeplin.io/project/5bc8c49fb3930253e4588db1)

### Sourcegraph development style guide

This style guide explains how to write code used in Sourcegraph.

### Sourcegraph copy style guide

This style guide explains how to write copy in Sourcegraph's voice.

### Sourcegraph design style guide

This style guide explains how to use design elements, how to place and space elements, and how to iterate on Sourcegraph's UI/UX design.

> NOTE: We are currently migrating our design style guide from Figma to Zeplin

Use the style guide in Zeplin unless an element is missing then refer to the archived style guide in Figma. Reach out to Francis for questions on missing styles or ambiguous elements.
