<!-- A short description of the problems this plan addresses and what will ship in its associated release milestone. -->

<!-- Either a Markdown checklist of tasks with issue links as needed: -->

- [ ] Issue 1 title #123
- [ ] Issue 2 title #456

<!-- or a link to an issue query: -->

[Issues](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+sort:updated-desc+label:mylabel+milestone:3.2)

## Test/review plan

<!-- This part of the template is experimental. We'll see how it goes -->

- Code reviewer: <!-- fill in @user(s) -->
- Tester: <!-- fill in @user(s) -->

<!-- This is how the project will be tested for the release. Fill this out with at least high-level details right now, and finish it by one week before the release. -->

<!-- Add other sections if needed to describe: future project work planned for the next release, technical or deadline risks, blockers/dependencies, backcompat/migration, or anything else important. -->
