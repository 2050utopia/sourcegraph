# Add repositories from other external services

If an integration for your external service is not yet offered, you can still connect to it.

Select **Other** from the **Kind** option list, then [configure](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/site_config/all#otherexternalserviceconnection-object) the list of Git clone URLs you want Sourcegraph to discover.

## Browser extension

The [Sourcegraph browser extension](../../integration/browser_extension.md) will work only with some of the external services for which it has a first class integration. If you're connecting your Git repositories here, it likely won't.
