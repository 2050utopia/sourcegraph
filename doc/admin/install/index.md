# Installing Sourcegraph

There are two ways of running Sourcegraph: Docker and Kubernetes.
## Docker

Single instance, great for supporting up to 500 users. Takes 5 minutes to install and configure.

**[Install Sourcegraph with Docker](../../index.md)**.

## Kubernetes

For companies managing code at a huge scale (hundreds or thousands of repositories) and/or 500+ users.

**[Install Sourcegraph with Kubernetes](cluster.md)**.
